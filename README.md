# Automated Penetration Testing and Monitoring Tool
A team of two other students and I worked closely with Reza Abdolee, a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at 
California State University Channel Islands, to develop an online cybersecurity monitoring platform for web applications and wireless networks. We were able to research 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities of computer systems, conduct hands-on penetration practice, and build on software development skill set. The product of this work is an automated penetration testing tool that can be run by regular computer users.
